    "When building a nonlinear model of an aircraft, you can find the stability characteristics by\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding a trim position of the aircraft (a set of thrust & control surface deflections that leads to equilibrium when the aircraft is in a given configuration)\n",
    "2. Linearizing the equations of motion about the trim position\n",
    "3. Decoupling the longitudinal and lateral / directional stability components if they are decoupled\n",
    "4. Finding the poles (eigenvalues) of the A matrix to determine the stability of the aircraft\n",
    "5. Determine which poles correspond to which dynamic modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can plot the behaviour of the aircraft around the given equilibrium point by forcing it with a 'doublet'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a medium-fidelity nonlinear model of the aircraft by \n",
    "* discretizing the aircraft into particular aerodynamic surfaces (each wing, maybe split into multiple sections for which sections have airfoils and which ones do not)\n",
    "* Calculating each surface individually\n",
    "* Add explicit terms for interaction between surfaces, eg the propwash over the main wing and tail and the downwash from the main wing over the tail of the craft\n",
    "\n",
    "The unfortunate fact about the nonlinear model of the craft is that it relies on a lot of aerodynamic data which you would really\n",
    "want to measure in a wind tunnel. We'll use potential-flow modelling to get these aerodynamic coefficients as much as possible,\n",
    "but we'll need to verify this performance against X-Plane and the physical model."
